### Racelogger
This module is responsible for extracting the data from the local running iRacing simulation software. 

_Racelogger_ is the data provider for the whole project.

### iRacelog Service Manager (Go)

This module is the main entry point to manage the backend services. It recieves messages from the _racelogger_ and is responsible for the following tasks

* archive the recieved messages from the _racelogger_
* compute additional stats (such as stint durations, driver seat times, driver laps)
* database migration

### iRacelog CLI 

Command line tool used for administrative tasks which are not yet available via web frontend. 

This tool is also used for stress tests during development.

## Components (retired)

[%header,format=dsv]
:===
Component:Version
iracelog-wamp-router: v0.0.2
racelogger (python): v0.8.0
iracelog-service-manager: v0.6.1
iracelog-analysis-service: v0.3.1
crossbar: v22.6.1
racelogctl: v0.4.0
:===

_iracelog-service-manager_ was replaced by the Go variant _iracelog-service-manager-go_

_iracelog-analysis-service_ was put out of order. Its tasks were integrated in _iracelog-service-manager-go_

_crossbar_ was replaced by the Go variant _iracelog-wamp-router_

_racelogger_ was replaced by the Go variant _go-racelogger_

_racelogctl_ was replaced by the gRPC variant _iracelog-cli_

_iracelog-wamp-router_ was no longer needed with the move from WAMP to gRPC



### iRacelog WAMP Router 

This module is the replacement for https://crossbar.io[Crossbar]. 

It serves as the central point for distributing messages between the components according to the WAMP specification.

While crossbar provides a lot of features we actually don't need much of them. The Nexus library in Go fullfills our needs and comes with a much smaller footprint.

### Racelogger (Python)
This module is responsible for extracting the data from the local running iRacing simulation software. 
The _racelogger_ uses the python module https://github.com/kutu/pyirsdk[pyirsdk] to get access to the iRacing telemetry data. 
_Racelogger_ is the data provider for the whole project.

### iRacelog Service Manager (Python)

This module is the main entry point to manage the backend services. It recieves messages from the _racelogger_ and is responsible for the distribution to other backend components, such as

* archive the recieved messages from the _racelogger_
* compute additional stats (such as stint durations, driver seat times, driver laps)
* gateway to linked subcomponents

### iRacelog Anaylsis Service

This module is responsible for processing incoming WAMP-messages from the _racelogger_. During live events it holds the current race state (including extra computations) and stores it periodically into the database.

### Deployment 

This repository contains samples for deploying the application in the following environments

* docker via docker compose
* kubernetes via Helm charts

CAUTION: The samples in this repository are designed for local test environments.

### Sample installation 

This setup is supposed for users who are familar with Linux servers. The ansible playbooks can be used to setup the application on IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) machines. 

The sample uses Hetzner (for IaaS) and Netcup (for domain services), but you may adjust the playbooks for other providers.
